# nsw_crime_data_iod_mini_project
 EDA & Hypothesis Testing for IOD Mini Project 1
 
This is the first assignment set to us in the Institute of Data - Data Science course. The focus was primarily on Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as Hypothesis Testing.
 
We were tasked with selecting a data set and analyse it using the techniques learned in the course up until this point, as well as prepare a 10-minute presentation, to present to the class.

The content was marked on the following rubric:
- Explanation of the business context behind the dataset
- Quality of presentation - engaging, well structured, not too short, or too long
- Quality of the notebook - code well documented, runs correctly
